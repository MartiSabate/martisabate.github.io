Thank you for visiting my first post!

My name is Mart√≠, and my goal with this blog is to share knowledge that may be interesting for the community, while I keep learning. Feel free to take your seat and enjoy my content!

I am going to upload mainly writeups from different platforms, vulnerability details, and technical posts. Additionally I will be sharing some experiences I have over my career.

If you have any suggestion or question, please feel free to contact me in Linkedin and I will be happy to connect.

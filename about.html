<h3>The Spark of Curiosity</h3>                                                                                                                                                                 
<p>It all began when I was young, sitting in front of a computer, introducing myself into the latest computer games on the browser.

These challenges inspired me to take further steps within the field that allowed me to provide better results and not just to play games. Over the time, curiosity brought me benefits as a better understanding of internet network communications and server administration.</p>

<h3>Inspired by Giants</h3>

<p>After some years, I was introduced to the cybersecurity field after following conferences and public presentations from experienced hackers in the community as Chema Alonso. Getting the shared knowledge and demystifying its complexities brought me getting the awareness of the cyber threads which motivated me to get involved in the industry and achieve a digital world safe for everyone.</p>

<h3>What Makes Cybersecurity Shine</h3>

<p>What captivates me most about cybersecurity is its dynamic nature of constant grow by appearing new vulnerabilities and techniques that may put in risk important actives in the world.
